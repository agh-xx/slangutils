DESCRIPTION:
System utilities written for Linux (but which they might work in other
Unix systems) in `S-Lang' programming language.

http://www.s-lang.org/

This project was created mainly for educational purposes, since I
believe `S-Lang' is well suited as an introductory language to (young)
students. 
It has a `C' like syntax which is easy to parse and understand, however
a student can write extensive code in a quite few lessons, without to 
have worry about the low level technical details, which they are required
in `C'.

The scripts are trying to emulate (with few exceptions), mainly the
Gnu-Coreutils, so there is nothing new to learn, if somebody is already
familiar with their Gnu-counterparts.

Many of the shared functions can be used in an interactive slsh session.
This it would be possible, if you put in ~/.slshrc something like:
 

variable
  slshpath = path_concat (getenv ("HOME"), "slang"),
  helpfiles = glob (path_concat (slshpath, "share/doc/*.hlp"));

set_doc_files ([helpfiles, get_doc_files ()]);

prepend_to_slang_load_path (path_concat (slshpath, "share/slsh"));

()= evalfile ("localload");


This is a work in progress and at early stage, as many advanced techniques
of `S-Lang', should be incorporated in the scripts with time. However are
usable for daily use, but they might contain uncoverable bugs, so the user
should be careful with their usage. Please report any bugs, at:

The License is the same as in `S-Lang', that is GPL:

NOTES:
Some functions are not available in the stable version of `S-Lang', that
is in the time of writing 2.2.2.

A git repository provided by upstream is available at:

git://git.jedsoft.org/git/slang.git


Some time algorithms are still in early stage.


THANKS:
Many Thanks to John E. Davis (S-Lang author) for his generous advices.
